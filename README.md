# So, what's different about this when compared to all older autosplitters?
- Overall more stability and consistency
- Much easier to recompile/modify
- Game Time and Real Time are separate
- Game Time in LiveSplit represents the exact in-game timer, meaning timing is incredibly accurate

# Features
- Automatic splitting across all main levels, with support for modded levels
- Automatic starting and resetting of splits
- Proper load remover that will remove the load times from the game in Real Time for the Game Time shown in LiveSplit
- Game Time in LiveSplit represents the exact in-game timer, meaning timing is incredibly accurate (déjà vu)

# Important notices!
- If the game is running on an uncapped framerate, the autosplitter may make errors more commonly than on 60 FPS. This autosplitter is calibrated to work mainly on 60 FPS
- This autosplitter and load remover was tested on a clean English version of Shrek 2 (PC); may not work on other native versions, or especially on modified directories

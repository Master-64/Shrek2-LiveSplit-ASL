- Overall more stability and consistency
- Much easier to recompile/modify
- Game time and Real time are separate
- Game time in LiveSplit represents the exact in-game timer, meaning timing is incredibly accurate

# Features
- Automatic splitting across all main levels, with support for modded levels (Note: manual split required for FGM!)
- Automatic starting and resetting of splits
- Proper load remover that will remove the load times from the game in real time for the game time shown in LiveSplit
- Game time in LiveSplit represents the exact in-game timer, meaning timing is incredibly accurate (déjà vu)
